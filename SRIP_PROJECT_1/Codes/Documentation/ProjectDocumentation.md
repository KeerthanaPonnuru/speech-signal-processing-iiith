# Experiment Project Documentation
---
## Introduction
This  document captures the technical details related to the experiment development.

## Project
**Domain Name :** Computer Science & Engineering

**Lab Name :** Speech Signal Processing Lab

**Experiment Name :** Basics of DSP

Digital Signal Processors (DSP) take real-world signals like voice, audio, video, temperature, pressure, or position that have been digitized and then mathematically manipulate them. A DSP is designed for performing mathematical functions like "add", "subtract", "multiply" and "divide" very quickly.


## Purpose of the project
Objective of this experiment is to study the effects of sampling (aliasing) and quantization on speech signals by playing them at different sampling rates and bits per sample (upto 1 bps) and to design a resonator by adjusting the poles in z-plane, and exciting it with an impulse and periodic impulse train.

## Process Followed to convert the experiment
1. Understand the assigned experiment Java simulation
2. Understanding the experiment concept
3. Re-implement the same in javascript

## Value Added by our Project
1. It would be beneficial for students studying Signal Processing have an easy interaction understanding using Tone.js library.

## Risks and Challenges
1. Creating the web page screen responsive and proper styling for various dimension screens.
2. Creating the transition features.
3. Understanding the installation of prerequisites.
4. Adding required functionalities.
